        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Ariana Alvarez, pronouns she/her, and I am nineteen years old. I am a Fulltime Student at the University of California, Riverside, majoring in Education, which is apart of the undergraduate School of Education Program. I am currently a second year, Sophomore; planning to take my Masters here as well. With my degree, if executed correctly, I intend to become a Teacher. Specifically, to teach Elementary students, any grade. <br><br>

        With my experience, as I will talk about in my resume, you will see my qualities and goals. Such as my passion and enjoyment that I have when I interact with kids. My past jobs have always been revolved around them, including my volunteer work. I have learned a lot; The best reason to be a teacher is that you want to have a positive, inspiring impact on children's lives. You achieve this by being kind, caring, empathic, passionate and funny. These are great qualities that a teacher should possess.Currently, I am preparing for a job that will allow me jump-start me to my career as being a teacher. I will start substituting! Coincidentally, becoming a substitute will help you gain the essential classroom experience that principals and superintendents look for when hiring. Plus, you'll have the opportunity to get your foot in the door with a district by networking with administrators and other teachers, and proving your teaching skills. The role magnifies the profession's biggest challengesâ€”the low pay, the insufficient time to plan, the ordeals of classroom management. However, I am excited to see what is to come and for my future!
<br><br>

        I often get asked, out of all the careers and paths I can go down, Why become a teacher? I want to become a teacher because I will have the ability to make a real difference in the lives of the children I will one day teach. Each day that I work with students, I have the potential to make a lasting impression. Almost all of us can remember something positive that one of our teachers said to us or the class as a whole. There were lessons that stick in our minds and impact our viewpoints for years. When it comes down to it, teaching is much more than just a way to get a paycheck. Becoming a teacher means making a difference in the lives of children, and shaping them into the adults theyâ€™ll become with lessons that will last a lifetime. All teachers do a great job and the teaching profession is a kind of social work. I wish all of us should spare some time in teaching students of their locality so that they can make sure that no child left without education. Teachers are not only those who teach us at school, it can be anyone who wants to educate society. My teachers always teach me to become a good human first thatâ€™s why they teach us good manners first because a gentleman can only make a better society.
